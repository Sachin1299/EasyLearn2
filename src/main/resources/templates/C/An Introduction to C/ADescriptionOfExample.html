        <h3>What was in it</h3>


        <p>Even such a small example has introduced a lot of&nbsp;C. Among other
            things, it contained two functions, a <code>#include</code>
            ‘statement’, and some <dfn>comment</dfn>. Since comment is the
            easiest bit to handle, let's look at that first.</p>

        <h3>Layout and comment</h3>

        <p>The layout of a C program is not very important to the compiler, although
            for readability it is important to use this freedom to carry extra
            information for the human reader. C allows you to put space, tab or newline
            characters practically anywhere in the program without any special effect
            on the meaning of the program. All of those three characters are the same
            as far as the compiler is concerned and are called collectively <dfn>white
                space</dfn>, because they just move the printing position without causing
            any ‘visible’ printing on an output device. White space can occur
            practically anywhere in a program except in the middle of
            <dfn>identifiers</dfn>, <dfn>strings</dfn>, or <dfn>character
                constants</dfn>. An identifier is simply the name of a function or some
            other object; strings and character constants will be discussed
            later—don't worry about them for the moment.
        </p>

        <p>Apart from the special cases, the only place that white space must be
            used is to separate things that would otherwise run together and become
            confused. In the example above, the fragment <code>void show_message</code>
            needs space to separate the two words, whereas <code>show_message(</code>
            could have space in front of the <code>(</code> or not, it would be purely
            a matter of taste.</p>

        <p>Comment is introduced to a C program by the pair of characters
            <code>/*</code>, which must not have a space between them. From then on,
            everything found up to and including the pair of characters <code>*/</code>
            is gobbled up and the whole lot is replaced by a single space. In Old C,
            this was not the case. The rule used to be that comment could occur
            anywhere that space could occur: the rule is now that comment is space. The
            significance of the change is minor and eventually becomes apparent in
            Chapter&nbsp;7 where we discuss the <dfn>preprocessor</dfn>. A
            consequence of the rule for the end of comment is that you can't put a
            piece of comment inside another piece, because the <em>first</em>
            <code>*/</code> pair will finish all of it. This is a minor nuisance, but
            you learn to live with it.
        </p>

        <p>It is common practice to make a comment stand out by making each line of
            multi-line comment always start with a&nbsp;<code>*</code>, as the example
            illustrates.</p>



        <h3>Preprocessor statements</h3>


        <p>The first statement in the example is a <dfn>preprocessor
                directive</dfn>. In days gone by, the C compiler used to have two phases:
            the <dfn>preprocessor</dfn>, followed by the real compiler. The
            preprocessor was a <dfn>macro processor</dfn>, whose job was to perform
            simple textual manipulation of the program before passing the modified text
            on to be compiled. The preprocessor rapidly became seen as an essential
            aspect of the compiler and so has now been defined as part of the language
            and cannot be bypassed.</p>

        <p>The preprocessor only knows about <em>lines</em> of text; unlike the rest
            of the language it is sensitive to the end of a line and though it is
            possible to write multi-line preprocessor directives, they are uncommon and
            a source of some wonder when they are found. Any line whose first visible
            character is a&nbsp;<code>#</code> is a preprocessor directive.</p>

        <p>In Example&nbsp;1.1 the preprocessor directive
            <code>#include</code> causes the line containing it to be replaced
            completely by the contents of another file. In this case the filename is
            found between the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> brackets. This is
            a widely used technique to incorporate the text of standard <dfn>header
                files</dfn> into your program without having to go through the effort of
            typing it all yourself. The <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> file is an
            important one, containing the necessary information that allows you to use
            the standard library for input and output. If you want to use the I/O
            library you <em>must</em> include <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>. Old C was
            more relaxed on this point.
        </p>

        <h3>Define statements</h3>


        <p>Another of the preprocessor's talents which is widely exploited is the
            <code>#define</code> statement. It is used like this:
        </p>

        <pre>#define IDENTIFIER      replacement</pre>

        <p>which says that the name represented by <code>IDENTIFIER</code> will be
            replaced by the text of replacement whenever <code>IDENTIFIER</code>
            occurs in the program text. Invariably, the identifier is a name in
            upper-case; this is a stylistic convention that helps the reader to
            understand what is going on. The replacement part can be any text at
            all—remember the preprocessor doesn't know&nbsp;C, it just works on
            text. The most common use of the statement is to declare names for
            constant numbers:</p>

        <pre>#define PI             3.141592
      #define SECS_PER_MIN   60
      #define MINS_PER_HOUR  60
      #define HOURS_PER_DAY  24</pre>

        <p>and to use them like this</p>

        <pre>circumf = 2*PI*radius;
      if(timer &gt;= SECS_PER_MIN){
      mins = mins+1;
              timer = timer - SECS_PER_MIN;
      }</pre>

        <p>the output from the preprocessor will be as if you had written this:</p>

        <pre>circumf = 2*3.141592*radius;
      if(timer &gt;= 60){
              mins = mins+1;
             timer = timer - 60;
      }</pre>



        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Preprocessor statements work on a line-by-line basis, the rest of C does
            not.</p>
        <p><code>#include</code> statements are used to read the contents of a
            specified file, typically to facilitate the use of library functions.</p>
        <p><code>#define</code> statements are typically used to give names for
            constants. By convention, the names are in upper case (capitalized).</p>







        <h3>Declaration</h3>


        <p>After the <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> file is included comes a
            <dfn>function declaration</dfn>; it tells the compiler that
            <code>show_message</code> is a function which takes no arguments and
            returns no values. This demonstrates one of the changes made by the
            Standard: it is an example of a <dfn>function prototype</dfn>, a subject
            which Chapter&nbsp;4 discusses in detail. It isn't always
            necessary to declare functions in advance—C will use some (old)
            default rules in such cases—but it is now strongly recommended that
            you <em>do</em> declare them in advance. The distinction between a
            <dfn>declaration</dfn> and a <dfn>definition</dfn> is that the former
            simply describes the type of the function and any arguments that it might
            take, the latter is where the body of a function is provided. These terms
            become more important later.
        </p>

        <p>By declaring <code>show_message</code> before it is used, the compiler
            is able to check that it is used correctly. The declaration describes
            three important things about the function: its name, its type, and the
            number and type of its arguments. The <code>void show_message(</code> part
            indicates that it is a function and that it returns a value of type
            <code>void</code>, which is discussed in a moment. The second use of
            <code>void</code> is in the declaration of the function's argument list,
            <code>(void)</code>, which indicates that there are <em>no</em> arguments
            to this function.
        </p>



        <h3>Definition</h3>


        <p>Right at the end of the program is the function definition itself;
            although it is only three lines long, it usefully illustrates a complete
            function.</p>

        <p>In C, functions perform the tasks that some other languages split into
            two parts. Most languages use a function to return a value of some sort,
            typical examples being perhaps trigonometric functions like sin, cos, or
            maybe a square root function; C is the same in this respect. Other similar
            jobs are done by what look very much like functions but which don't return
            a value: FORTRAN uses <dfn>subroutines</dfn>, Pascal and Algol call them
            <dfn>procedures</dfn>. C simply uses functions for all of those jobs, with
            the <em>type</em> of the function's return value specified when the
            function is defined. In the example, the function
            <code>show_message</code> doesn't return a value so we specify that its
            type is <code>void</code>.
        </p>

        <p>The use of <code>void</code> in that way is either crashingly obvious or
            enormously subtle, depending on your viewpoint. We could easily get
            involved here in an entertaining (though fruitless) philosophical
            side-track on whether <code>void</code> really is a value or not, but we
            won't. Whichever side of the question you favour, it's clear that you
            can't do anything with a <code>void</code> and that's what it means
            here—“I don't want to do anything with any value this function
            might or might not return”.</p>

        <p>The type of the function is <code>void</code>, its name is
            <code>show_message</code>. The parentheses&nbsp;<code>()</code> following
            the function name are needed to let the compiler know that at this point
            we are talking about a function and not something else. If the function
            did take any arguments, then their names would be put between the
            parentheses. This one doesn't take any, which is made explicit by putting
            <code>void</code> between the parentheses.
        </p>

        <p>For something whose essence is emptiness, abnegation and rejection,
            <code>void</code> turns out to be pretty useful.
        </p>

        <p>The body of the function is a <dfn>compound statement</dfn>, which is a
            sequence of other statements surrounded by curly
            brackets&nbsp;<code>{}</code>. There is only one statement in there, but
            the brackets are still needed. In general, C allows you to put a compound
            statement anywhere that the language allows the use of a single simple
            statement; the job of the brackets being to turn several statements in a
            row into what is effectively a single statement.</p>

        <p>It is reasonable to ask whether or not the brackets are strictly needed,
            if their only job is to bind multiple statements into one, yet all that we
            have in the example is a single statement. Oddly, the answer is
            yes—they <em>are</em> strictly needed. The only place in C where you
            can't put a single statement but <em>must</em> have a compound statement
            is when you are defining a function. The simplest function of all is
            therefore the empty function, which does nothing at all:</p>

        <pre>void do_nothing(void){}</pre>

        <p>The statement inside show_message is a call of the library function
            <code>printf</code>. <code>printf</code> is used to format and print
            things, this example being one of the simplest of its
            uses. <code>printf</code> takes one or more arguments, whose values are
            passed forward from the point of the call into the function itself. In
            this case the argument is a <dfn>string</dfn>. The contents of the string
            are interpreted by <code>printf</code> and used to control the way the
            values of the other arguments are printed. It bears a little resemblance
            to the FORMAT statement in FORTRAN; but not enough to predict how to use
            it.
        </p>



        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p><dfn>Declarations</dfn> are used to introduce the name of a function,
            its return type and the type (if any) of its arguments.</p>
        <p>A function <dfn>definition</dfn> is a declaration with the body of the
            function given too.</p>
        <p>A function returning no value should have its type declared as
            <code>void</code>. For example,
            <code>void&nbsp;func(/*&nbsp;list&nbsp;of&nbsp;arguments&nbsp;*/);</code>
        </p>
        <p>A function taking no arguments should be declared with <code>void</code>
            as its argument list. For example, <code>void func(void);</code></p>

        <h3>Strings</h3>


        <p>In C, strings are a sequence of characters surrounded by quote marks:</p>

        <pre>"like this"</pre>

        <p>Because a string is a single element, a bit like an identifier, it is not
            allowed to continue across a line—although space or tab characters
            are permitted inside a string.</p>

        <pre>"This is a valid string"
      "This has a newline in it
      and is NOT a valid string"</pre>

        <p>To get a very long string there are two things that you can do. You could
            take advantage of the fact that absolutely everywhere in a C program, the
            sequence ‘backslash end-of-line’ disappears totally.</p>

        <pre>"This would not be valid but doesn't have \
      a newline in it as far as the compiler is concerned"</pre>

        <p>The other thing you could do is to to use the string joining feature,
            which says that two adjacent strings are considered to be just one.</p>

        <pre>"All this " "comes out as "
      "just one string"</pre>

        <p>Back to the example. The sequence ‘<code>\n</code>’ in the
            string is an example of an <dfn>escape</dfn> sequence which in this case
            represents ‘newline’. <code>Printf</code> simply prints the
            contents of the string on the program's output file, so the output will
            read ‘hello’, followed by a new line.</p>

        <p>To support people working in environments that use character sets which
            are ‘wider’ than U.S. ASCII, such as the shift-JIS representation
            used in Japan, the Standard now allows <dfn>multibyte characters</dfn> to
            be present in strings and comments. The Standard defines the
            96&nbsp;characters that are the alphabet of C (see <a href="../chapter2/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>). If
            your system supports an extended character set, the only
            place that you may use these extended characters is in strings, character
            constants, comment and the names of <dfn>header files</dfn>. Support for
            extended character sets is an implementation defined feature, so you will
            have to look it up in your system's documentation.</p>



        <h3>The main function</h3>


        <p>In Example&nbsp;1.1 there are actually two functions,
            <code>show_message</code> and <code>main</code>. Although main is a bit
            longer than <code>show_message</code> it is obviously built in the same
            shape: it has a name, the parentheses () are there, followed by the opening
            bracket <code>{</code> of the compound statement that must follow in a
            function definition. True, there's a lot more stuff too, but right at the
            end of the example you'll find the matching closing bracket <code>}</code>
            that goes with the first one to balance the numbers.
        </p>

        <p>This is a much more realistic function now, because there are several
            statements inside the function body, not just one. You might also have
            noticed that the function is <em>not</em> declared to be
            <code>void</code>. There is a good reason for this: it returns a proper
            value. Don't worry about its arguments yet; they are discussed in
            Chapter&nbsp;10.
        </p>

        <p>The most important thing about <code>main</code> is that it is the first
            function to be called. In a hosted environment your C language system
            arranges, magically, for a call on the <code>main</code> function (hence
            its name) when the program is first started. When the function is over, so
            is the program. It's obviously an important function. Equally important is
            the stuff <em>inside</em> <code>main</code>'s compound statement. As
            mentioned before, there can be several statements inside a compound
            statement, so let's look at them in turn.</p>

        <h3>Declarations</h3>


        <p>The first statement is this:</p>

        <pre>int count;</pre>

        <p>which is not an instruction to do anything, but simply introduces a
            variable to the program. It declares something whose name is
            <code>count</code>, and whose type is ‘integer’; in C the
            keyword that declares integers is unaccountably shortened to
            <code>int</code>. C has an idiosyncratic approach to these keywords with
            some having their names spelled in full and some being shortened like
            <code>int</code>. At least <code>int</code> has a meaning that is more or
            less intuitive; just wait until we get on to <code>static</code>.
        </p>

        <p>As a result of that declaration the compiler now knows that there is
            something that will be used to store integral quantities, and that its name
            is <code>count</code>. In C, all variables must be declared before they are
            used; there is none of FORTRAN's implicit declarations. In a compound
            statement, all the declarations must come first; they must precede any
            ‘ordinary’ statements and are therefore somewhat special.</p>

        <p>(Note for pedants: unless you specifically ask, the declaration of a
            variable like <code>count</code> is also a <dfn>definition</dfn>. The
            distinction will later be seen to matter.)</p>

        <h3>Assignment statement</h3>


        <p>Moving down the example we find a familiar thing, an <dfn>assignment
                statement</dfn>. This is where the first value is assigned to the variable
            <code>count</code>, in this case the value assigned is a constant whose
            value is zero. Prior to the assignment, the value of <code>count</code>
            was undefined and unsafe to use. You might be a little surprised to find
            that the assignment symbol (strictly speaking an <dfn>assignment
                operator</dfn>) is a single <code>=</code> sign. This is not fashionable
            in modern languages, but hardly a major blemish.
        </p>

        <p>So far then, we have declared a variable and assigned the value of zero
            to it. What next?</p>

        <h3>The while statement</h3>

        <p>Next is one of C's loop control statements, the while statement. Look
            carefully at its form. The formal description of the <code>while</code>
            statement is this:</p>

        <pre>while(<var>expression</var>)
              <var>statement</var></pre>

        <p>Is that what we have got? Yes it is. The bit that reads</p>

        <pre>count &lt; 10</pre>

        <p>is a <dfn>relational expression</dfn>, which is an example of a valid
            expression, and the expression is followed by a compound statement, which
            is a form of valid statement. As a result, it fits the rules for a properly
            constructed <code>while</code> statement.</p>

        <p>What it does must be obvious to anyone who has written programs
            before. For as long as the relationship <code>count &lt; 10</code> holds
            true, the body of the loop is executed and the comparison repeated. If the
            program is ever to end, then the body of the loop must do something that
            will eventually cause the comparison to be false: of course it does.</p>

        <p>There are just two statements in the body of the loop. The first one is a
            function call, where the function <code>show_message</code> is invoked. A
            function call is indicated by the name of the function followed by the
            parentheses&nbsp;<code>()</code> which contain its argument list—if it
            takes no arguments, then you provide none. If there were any arguments,
            they would be put between the parentheses like this:</p>

        <pre>/* call a function with several arguments */
      function_name(first_arg, second_arg, third_arg);</pre>

        <p>and so on. The call of <code>printf</code> is another example. More is
            explained in Chapter&nbsp;4.</p>

        <p>The last statement in the loop is another assignment statement. It adds
            one to the variable <code>count</code>, so that the requirement for program
            to stop will eventually be met.</p>



        <h3>The return statement</h3>


        <p>The last statement that is left to discuss is the <code>return</code>
            statement. As it is written, it looks like another function call, but in
            fact the rule is that the statement is written</p>

        <pre>return <var>expression</var>;</pre>

        <p>where the <em>expression</em> is optional. The example uses a common
            stylistic convention and puts the <em>expression</em> into parentheses,
            which has no effect whatsoever.</p>

        <p>The return causes a value to be returned from the current function to its
            caller. If the expression is missing, then an unknown value is passed back
            to the caller—this is almost certainly a mistake unless the function
            returns <code>void</code>. <code>Main</code> wasn't declared with any type
            at all, unlike <code>show_message</code>, so what type of value does it
            return? The answer is <code>int</code>. There are a number of places where
            the language allows you to declare things by default: the default type of
            functions is <code>int</code>, so it is common to see them used in this
            way. An equivalent declaration for <code>main</code> would have been</p>

        <pre>int main(){</pre>

        <p>and exactly the same results would have occurred.</p>

        <p>You can't use the same feature to get a default type for variables
            because their types must be provided explicitly.</p>

        <p>What does the value returned from <code>main</code> mean, and where does
            it go? In Old C, the value was passed back to the operating system or
            whatever else was used to start the program running. In a UNIX-like
            environment, the value of <code>0</code> meant ‘success’ in some way,
            any other value (often <code>-1</code>) meant ‘failure’. The Standard
            has enshrined this, stating that <code>0</code> stands for correct
            termination of the program. This <em>does not</em> mean that 0 is to be
            passed back to the host environment, but whatever is the appropriate
            ‘success’ value for that system. Because there is sometimes confusion
            around this, you may prefer to use the defined values
            <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code> and <code>EXIT_FAILURE</code> instead, which are
            defined in the header file <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>. Returning from
            the <code>main</code> function is the same as calling the library function
            <code>exit</code> with the return value as an argument. The difference is
            that exit may be called from <em>anywhere</em> in the program, and
            terminates it at that point, after doing some tidying up activities. If you
            intend to use <code>exit</code>, you <em>must</em> include the header file
            <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>. From now on, we shall use <code>exit</code>
            rather than returning from <code>main</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The <code>main</code> function returns an <code>int</code> value.</p>
        <p>Returning from <code>main</code> is the same as calling the
            <code>exit</code> function, but <code>exit</code> can be called from
            anywhere in a program.
        </p>
        <p>Returning <code>0</code> or <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code> is the way of
            indicating success, anything else indicates failure.</p>




        <h3>Progress so far</h3>


        <p>This example program, although short, has allowed us to introduce several
            important language features, amongst them:</p>
